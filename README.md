# CoDWaWZMAutotimer

a livesplit auto timer for Call of Duty: World at War Zombies


# Configuration


open LiveSplit.exe and right click timer


select Edit Layout -> click the plus sign -> Control -> Scriptable Auto Splitter


double click Scriptable Auto Splitter tab. select the asl file. (use the der riese/snn asl file for a more accurate timing method that starts the timer when round 1 is loaded into memory)


side note: your split times MUST be set in the game time tab ( Edit Splits -> Game Time tab (just CTRL+C all your times from real time to game time tab) )

# TODO

add auto splitting functionalities (automatically split on when round changes to what round you have in your own split file)


<s> find round memory addresses for nacht and verruckt and add auto timing functionality to them </s> ( used snapshot entities to start timer (inaccurate on nacht but works fine on verruckt) )
